Welcome to my_mastermind! This is a simple implementation of the classic code-breaking game, Mastermind, developed in [insert programming language here].

## Overview

Mastermind is a code-breaking game where one player (the code-maker) sets a secret code, and the other player (the code-breaker) tries to guess the code within a certain number of attempts. The code-breaker receives feedback after each guess to help refine subsequent guesses.

This implementation allows you to play Mastermind against the computer. You can set the length of the code and the number of attempts allowed.

## Features

- Customizable game settings (code length, number of attempts).
- Clear and user-friendly interface.
- Feedback mechanism to help guide the player's guesses.
- Randomly generated secret code.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/my_mastermind.git
Navigate into the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd my_mastermind
[Insert any additional installation instructions if necessary, such as dependencies or environment setup.]
Usage
Run the main script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the prompts to set up the game and start playing.

Enter your guesses based on the feedback provided after each attempt.

Keep guessing until you either break the code or run out of attempts.

Enjoy the game!
